This directory contains several recordings of accelerometer data obtained from
an iPhone and stored as sequences for Pd's [qlist] object.

Also some Pd patches to play back and visualise the data are included. 

Accelerometer data: 

data0.txt: walking around with iphone in pocket
data1.txt: twisting x axis
data2.txt: twisting y axis
data3.txt: twisting z axis
data4.txt: shaking around

Main abstractions:

testaccel.pd: playback the files from above, optionally looped and with various
    speeds.

accelvis.pd: rough Gem visualisation of the iPhone position.

Helper abstractions: 

readdata.pd: reads a data file into qlist and plays it back.
showdata.pd: three sliders to view x, y and z accelerations.
ipodmodel.pd: Crude Gem model of an iPod/iPhone
integrate.pd: running sum of 10 float values, scaled by 1/10
integ2.pd: integrate twice with with integrate.pd

Authors: Guenter Geiger, Frank Barknecht, Paul Brossier and probably others.
